# Welcome!

Welcome to the “I’m Learning” series. In this series I’m gonna share my learning progress in different subjects. This is not a tutorial. I’m just learning new stuff just all by myself.

But still you can learn something too. Like what?

• How to use Google to learn something.
• How to create a path to learn anything.
• I’m gonna try to explain how programming works.
• Maybe you can learn something about topics that in series.


# What We Gonna Do Now?

First thing first we need to realize that programming is a cause for need. So we gonna act like we need something. For example: a calculator, a chat bot, a data management etc..

Just be sure about start with basic things. And prepare for doing a lot of research, like a lot. Seriously a lot.


# Before We Start

For writing some programs we need a IDE (Integrated Development Environment). I suggest Visual Studio if you start at zero. It’s a wonderful program to learn. But you can use a text editor too like me. In this series I’m not going to teach Visual Studio. You need to do that yourself (Sorry :/).

But don’t worry I got you. Here is a link that you can explore more about Visual Studio. https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics


# Result

If we agreed all at that stuff, we can start learning together. Join me the links below.
